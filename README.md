# Anti-Cheat Detection Agent

**Hybrid Rule + Machine Learning System for Real-Time Gameplay Anomaly Detection**
*(Developed by Janie Shin)*

---

## üìñ Overview

This project implements a **hybrid anti-cheat detection system** that combines **statistical anomaly rules** with a **machine-learning model** to identify suspicious gameplay behavior from player telemetry.

It simulates a lightweight in-game monitoring agent that detects irregular motion patterns, latency anomalies, or injected actions ‚Äî mimicking the internal structure of professional game security systems like **Riot Vanguard**, **Valve VACNet**, or **Blizzard Warden**.

---

**Components:**

* **`game_harness/`** ‚Äì Generates synthetic gameplay telemetry (`data/telemetry.csv`).
* **`agent/`** ‚Äì Reads telemetry, runs detection (rules + ML), and outputs `data/eval.csv`.
* **`models/`** ‚Äì Stores JSON-exported logistic regression models.
* **`notebooks/`** ‚Äì Python notebooks for training, visualization, and threshold tuning.
* **`common/`** ‚Äì Shared logging utilities and JSON parser.

## üöÄ Features

| Feature                          | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rule-Based Anomaly Detection** | Detects abnormal speeds using mean ¬± 3œÉ, median ¬± MAD, and hard caps.                                    |
| **Machine Learning Detector**    | Logistic regression trained on synthetic telemetry; exported as JSON and loaded into C++.                |
| **Hybrid Gating**                | Alerts only when both ML and rules agree ‚Äî reducing false positives.                                     |
| **Evaluation Logging**           | Writes detailed evaluation (`tick`, `speed`, `ml_prob`, `rule_alert`, `cheat_flag`) for ROC/PR analysis. |
| **Visualization Toolkit**        | Jupyter notebooks to inspect coefficients, plot ROC/PR curves, and tune thresholds.                      |
| **Cross-Platform Build**         | Compiles on macOS/Linux using CMake; Windows stubs provided for extension.                               |

## üß† Why It Matters

This project demonstrates how **AI-assisted security agents** operate in real-time environments:

* **Telemetry ingestion** ‚Üí continuous behavior monitoring.
* **Anomaly detection** ‚Üí fast, interpretable thresholds for outlier behavior.
* **ML inference** ‚Üí adaptive models that learn typical vs. abnormal play.
* **Hybrid fusion** ‚Üí the balance between precision (few false alerts) and recall (few misses).

It reflects the design principles used in modern **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** tools, **esports anti-cheat**, and **cloud anomaly systems**.

## üß© Build & Run

### **Prerequisites**

* macOS / Linux (tested on macOS 15)
* CMake ‚â• 3.16
* C++17 compiler (Clang / g++)
* Python ‚â• 3.10 with packages:
  `numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter`

### **Setup**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anti-cheat.git
cd anti-cheat
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Build**

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

### **Run**

```bash
# Generate gameplay telemetry
./build/game_harness/game_harness

# Run rule-based detection only
./build/agent/agent --quiet --eval=data/eval_rules.csv

# Run hybrid (rule + ML)
AC_HYBRID=1 ./build/agent/agent --quiet --eval=data/eval_hybrid.csv
```

Results are written to:

```
data/telemetry.csv
data/eval_rules.csv
data/eval_hybrid.csv
```

## üìä Analysis & Visualization

Run the notebook:

```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook eval_visuals.ipynb
```

You‚Äôll see:

* **Coefficient ranking** (most influential features)
* **ROC / PR curves** for rule, ML, and hybrid detectors
* **Threshold sweeps** to tune decision boundary
* **Timeline plots** of ML probabilities and cheat ticks

* Extend telemetry with **mouse/keyboard input**, **network jitter**, etc.
* Integrate **real-time dashboard** (Flask + Plotly or Grafana).
* Push alerts to **AWS CloudWatch** or **Slack webhook**.
* Explore **online retraining** to adapt to new cheat patterns.
